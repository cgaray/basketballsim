## 🗄 Database Schema

### Players Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  position TEXT NOT NULL,
  team TEXT,
  season INTEGER,
  games_played INTEGER,
  points_per_game REAL,
  rebounds_per_game REAL,
  assists_per_game REAL,
  steals_per_game REAL,
  blocks_per_game REAL,
  field_goal_percentage REAL,
  three_point_percentage REAL,
  free_throw_percentage REAL,
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Teams Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT,
  players JSON, -- Array of player IDs
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Matches Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE matches (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  team1_id INTEGER,
  team2_id INTEGER,
  team1_score INTEGER,
  team2_score INTEGER,
  winner_id INTEGER,
  play_by_play JSON,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/bug-description` - Critical bug fixes

### Feature Development Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. Code review and testing
5. Merge to `develop`
6. Deploy to staging for testing
7. Merge `develop` to `main` for production

## 🔧 Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./nba.sqlite"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] Load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## 🐛 Known Challenges
1. **Large Dataset**: NBA database is 2.2GB - need efficient querying
2. **Real-time Updates**: Smooth simulation updates without blocking UI
3. **AI Integration**: Managing API costs and rate limits
4. **Mobile Performance**: Ensuring smooth drag-and-drop on touch devices

## 📝 Notes
- Database file (nba.sqlite) should never be committed to Git
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Focus on user experience and intuitive interface
