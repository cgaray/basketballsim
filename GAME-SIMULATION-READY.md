## Technical Implementation

### Simulation Algorithm

**Player Selection**:
- Point Guards: 1.5x more likely to handle ball
- Shooting Guards: 1.2x more likely
- Based on PPG + (APG × 2)

**Shot Types**:
- 5% Free Throws
- 20-35% Three-Pointers (if good 3P%)
- 30-50% Layups (more for C/PF)
- Rest: Mid-range jumpers

**Success Rates**:
- Three: Player's 3P%
- Layup: FG% + 15%
- Mid-range: Player's FG%
- Free Throw: Player's FT%
- ±10% variance for realism

**Rebounds**:
- 70% defensive, 30% offensive
- Centers: 1.5x weight
- Power Forwards: 1.3x weight

**MVP Scoring**:
```
Score = Points + (Rebounds × 1.2) + (Assists × 1.5) + (Steals × 2) + (Blocks × 2)
```

## Performance

**Speed**:
- Team selection: Instant
- Game simulation: <100ms
- Results display: <500ms total
- **Total time from click to results: ~2 seconds**

**Efficiency**:
- No blocking animations
- Lightweight calculation
- Minimal re-renders
- Fast database saves

---

## Known Limitations

These are NOT bugs, just simplifications we chose:

1. **No real-time animation**: Game simulates all at once (FEATURE: kids don't want to wait!)
2. **Random variation**: Each game is slightly different (FEATURE: replayability!)
3. **Simplified fouls**: Not heavily tracked (FEATURE: keeps it simple!)
4. **Auto-save only**: Matches saved automatically (FEATURE: no extra clicks!)

---

## Future Ideas (For Later!)

Want to make it even better? Consider:

- 🎤 AI play-by-play announcer (OpenAI integration)
- 📊 Season mode with standings
- 🏆 Playoff brackets
- 📈 Player hot/cold streaks
- 🎮 "Sim to end" vs "Play quarter by quarter"
- 📱 Better mobile controls
- 🎯 Clutch moments (buzzer beaters!)
- 📸 Screenshot/share results
- 🏅 Trophy case for wins
